# Lists and strings (which you have already seen) and sets and dictionaries (which are coming up soon) are objects. There is special terminology for talking about objects:
# A method is a function defined on an object.
# You don’t “call” methods. You send messages to an object. This is unwieldy, so I like to say you talk to objects.
